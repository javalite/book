# Foreword 

Why JavaLite was created: 

* Igor started writing in Java in 1996, when Java was fun. It offered a huge productivity leap compared to C++.
* Igor developed a first web app in 1999, but since containers were not available or were very buggy, he developed the entire web 
    server, a form of a templating system and a way to write code fast, without realizing this was a product in itself.
* Web just started to come out if its infancy and Sun released very useful specifications, such as JDBC and Servlets API. 
* Late 90s Java was all the ragem and Sun pushed out so-called Enterprise standards, which immediately killed all the productivity. 
* That took out the wind out of a fresh breath Java had in the 90s and killed the speed of develppment. 
* In early 2000s, Java was hard, and Spring came out to aleviate some pains. 
* Rails came out in 2005, and Igor was at the SD West conference, seeing the Rails presentation. 
** The presenter focused on building pretty HTML, so Igor "did not get" it
* In 2007, Sears project was done in a typical Java "agile" fashion: Spring, Hybernate, Struts. It was slow to execute and slow to develop. 
* A few Rails developers joined the project and convinced the Sears management that Rails is better.
* In a typical Sears management style (no analysis), the management made a technical decision to keep the existing Java features but build all new features in Rails in a mixed technical environment. 
* From a tech stand point, it was very hard, but presented an opportulity to learn Rails 
* Rails turned out to be was very impressive because: 
  * It was the first comprehensive framework with everything built to work together: 
  * processing web requests, 
  * generating views, 
  * access to database
  * db migrations
  * Logging
  * Caching
  * Etc.
  
In other words, it was build to have alll components as opposed to having to integrate them by hand. 

The Ruby as a language was easy to pickup if you are a Java developer (I would argue it is much the same as 
Java, despite that Ruby developers at the time), but it was the frameworks approach to

# Introduction

This books is long overdue. The initial code for the framework was written and and put into production back in 2009, and 
powered a massive product for a well known insurance company. In other words, the initial deployment was already commercial and 
development rose from the necessity to have a technology that  allowed the following:

* Minimal code 
* Almost no  configuration
* Fast development cycle
* Ability to  write readable code, since maintenance is a bulk of software cost. 


##  About This Book

##  Who should read this book

* A Java developer - beginner, journeyman and a master, anyone can  benefit 
 
##  Goals

* Gaining  understanding of the agile approach for building modern business systems 
in Java with the help of JavaLite.  
 

##  Required Technology

* The Java Programming language
* At least a cursory understanding of SQL and relational databases.
* Some understanding of web applications practices and some standards,
    * HTTP
    * Ajax
    * REST

## What is JavaLite

* Umbrella  for AJ, AW, Async, Migrator, etc. 
* Each component can be used independently and also together 
* Simplicity is a driving factor 


### Principles: 

* Get the best idea from Ruby on Rails, as long as they still make sense in Java 
* Get  the best ideas  from Java, including low level specifications: JDBC, JMS, Servlets, Maven, Gradle, Jar, War deployment.
* Stay container - agnostic  
* Allow to use any other tools Java developers use. 
* Allow for fast prototyping 
* Provide everything you need in a typical app, aside from specialized features
* Provide the highest levels of support for TDD. Tests  (also known as specs) are the backbone of modern software development. 

### Components

* ActiveJDBC - description here 
* ActiveWeb - ---
* DBMigrator - --
* JSpec - - 
* Async ---
* AppConfig


## ActiveJDBC ORM and the database access

### Low level, just above JDBC

* Connection management uses ThreadLocal a novel idea - parallel to Aspect-oriented programming   
* Describe DB  and  Base classes
